<!--The idea is having a menu for profil, mods list, tutorial.
      The main page has an auto scroll of all my mods, with a short presentation block and a welcome block.
      Profil is the full presentation of me, of why I do and what I plan.
      Mod List is the full list with short details and links
      Tutorial for how to mod the game, how to use Script Merger, how to check outdated mod and how to update

        <pre class="mystory">
        I'm ElementaryLewis, knows also as Lewis Elementary, or simply Lewis. I joins the Witcher 3 Modding community since summer 2021, right after I bought a new PC and the games.
        At this time, I knew too little about programming but I plan to learn more about it and make it a job.
        
        It happens to me that I installed and changed so much mods that evidently, I encounter merge problem, such error compilation and merged conflict.
        Regular people would ask help or search the solution. But not me! The first error I saw, I reuse Script Merger, try to find which mod cause the error and fix it. And the more I try to fix, the more I learn how to solve merged conflict and errors compilation. I constantly learn from my own mistakes and understand how scripts or XMLs is written.
        Months latter, I was able to understand how mod works until I reach the point I directly edit the files throught Script Merger and I realise just after "Wait? Did I make my own mod?!".

        So I took the courage to learn how to use WolvenKit, looking for reference, asking helps, ect...
        My first idea was "Hmm... I like Swap Witcher Armor Appearance but I wish it change the swords too." So I look inside the files, learn how it change, try to apply the same into swords. BOOM! My first mod "Swap Witcher Swords Appearance" was borned.

        That's the story of someone who knows too little of programming but can now make simple but nice mods. I project to study in programming and make a job, just because manipulating code and data, it's something I like.


        By coincidence, I witness the rise of the mod "Brothers In Arms". I remember it was called "PaulR0013's Complete Bug Fix Collection", made only by... PaulR0013.
        I didn't track nor read comments but I check everytime if an update is avalaible, and Complete Bug Fix Collection was always there. I check each time what's the new fixes, praising the great job, and then... it became Brothers In Arms.
        Massive collaboration between three passsionate modder, determine to fix and restore much from the game. It was the gaze of my eyes, seeing how passionate modder are, seeking collaboration each other and all. It was a dream for me.
        So I immediatly joins the community: questions, answer, praise, critics, etc... I wanted to do something for them by making a compatibility patch for Warmly Dressed Skelliger mod, then finding fix or fix it, and helping people of their trouble.
        I matured so much with the community, I learn each from my exploit and from my own mistake. They are so cheerful, I don't want to lose them.

        It's not only Brothers In Arms, the whole The Witcher 3 Modding are actually. I learn much from their philosophy. When the Next Gen patch was announced, I resent the fear from them, the fear of redoing what they create before or facing new obstacle.
        I realise they need helps. I took the courage to contact Wolven Workshop about the possibility to gather much information from the Next Gen patch, and how should we make a comparison to Classic 1.32.
        After a brainstorming, reflection and idea, we were able to create the Next-Gen Patch Changelog: a full details of every change between 1.32 and 4.00.
        Some were sceptical or thought how it was be a waste of time. But I did it nonetheless, I wanted to gather the most accessible and useful information about the Next Gen patch. And it does! Many mods were saved by passionate player who doesn't want their favourite mods being broken. Many modder was relief to see some of their mods still work on Next Gen.
        Those were my goal, I accomplish it thanks to the brillant mind of Wolven Workshop.


        Now? Well I'm studying on programming. I'm already ready to port some outdated mod on Next Gen and I prepare to create many mods.
        There is one big project I want to do first before I play The Witcher Trilogy. And another project after I play The Witcher 3. How long would it take, I don't know, but it's written in the Lebioda's Prophecy.
